# CERN technical student notes
Notes on how to increase your chances at getting accepted for the technical student programme at CERN. The Technical Student Programme at CERN allows students from the Bachelor's and the Master's degree to go to work at CERN for 4-12 months for a studentship. Be sure to have a look at [careers.cern](careers.cern) and at the [official programme page](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/CERN/tech).

Since most of this informations lay around in the internet (mostly on [r/CERN](reddit.com/r/CERN)) but in little bits everywhere, i decided to gather it all in one spot. I take no responsiblity for the information here, this is just what i did (and i did not even manage to get accepted yet). 

The fields in which you can apply are:
- applied physics;
- electrical or electronics engineering;
- general  or civil engineering; 
- IT, mathematics and robotics; 
- material and surface science;
- mechanical engineering.


Acceptance rate is pretty low, but nothing impossible. It is (much) higher for students from member states. 
This is the acceptance rate for the last years:
| Year | Applications | Selected | Success rate |
|------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 2020 |         2169 |      156 |        7,19% |
| 2019 |         2505 |      143 |        5,71% |
| 2018 |         2161 |       90 |        4,16% |
| 2017 |         1248 |      222 |       17,79% |
| 2016 |         1350 |      233 |       17,26% |

On why it did drop after 2018 is beyond my understanding currently.


# Preparing your application
There are two committees every year, one in May and one in December. The deadline for the committee in may is around the end of march, while the deadline for the december committee is around October. Apply for a particular selection round if you're aiming to start 1-6 months after the committee.
Take your time to prepare your application, there is no advantage in sending it first or sooner. Just be sure to send it before the deadline. 

Cern has it's own page for tips [here](https://careers.cern/tips-applying).

- You can stay for at least 4 and at most 12 months **remaining registered as a full-time student.**
