# CERN technical student notes
Notes on how to increase your chances at getting accepted for the technical student programme at CERN. The Technical Student Programme at CERN allows students from the Bachelor's and the Master's degree to go to work at CERN for 4-12 months for a studentship. Be sure to have a look at [careers.cern](careers.cern) and at the [official programme page](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/CERN/tech).

Since most of this informations lay around in the internet (mostly on [r/CERN](reddit.com/r/CERN)) but in little bits everywhere, i decided to gather it all in one spot. I take no responsiblity for the information here, this is just what i learned (and i did not even manage to get accepted yet). 

The fields in which you can apply are:
- applied physics;
- electrical or electronics engineering;
- general  or civil engineering; 
- IT, mathematics and robotics; 
- material and surface science;
- mechanical engineering.


Acceptance rate is pretty low, but nothing impossible. It is (much) higher for students from member states. 
This is the acceptance rate for the last years:
| Year | Applications | Selected | Success rate |
|------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 2020 |         2169 |      156 |        7,19% |
| 2019 |         2505 |      143 |        5,71% |
| 2018 |         2161 |       90 |        4,16% |
| 2017 |         1248 |      222 |       17,79% |
| 2016 |         1350 |      233 |       17,26% |

On why it did drop after 2018 is beyond my understanding currently.


# Preparing your application
There are two committees every year, one in May and one in December. The deadline for the committee in may is around the end of march, while the deadline for the december committee is around October. Apply for a particular selection round if you're aiming to start 1-6 months after the committee.
Take your time to prepare your application, there is no advantage in sending it first or sooner. Just be sure to send it before the deadline. 

Cern has it's own page for tips [here](https://careers.cern/tips-applying).

## Requirements
The requirements to apply for a technical student position are stated in the website, but unfortunately the requirements are not available until the applications open, so here they are:
- You are a national of a [CERN Member or Associate Member State](http://home.cern/about/member-states).
- You have completed at least 18 months of your undergraduate studies (Bachelor or Master’s) at the time of the next student selection taking place in [...]. Please note that PhD students are not eligible for this programme.
- You can stay for at least 4 and at most 12 months **remaining registered as a full-time student.**
- You have a good knowledge of English OR French.

Note that you cannot graduate or finish your studies during the technical student programme, you will need to remain enrolled.

## Your CV
A short CV that catches the eye is better than a long CV everything you did in your life in detail. A couple of pages should be enough for a student. Select the relevant experiences. As recruiters often say: "If you're enrolled in university, we can probably figure out that you did high school too". No need to specify.

Be sure to mention any relevant project you did. University assignments work too. If you have nothing to mention, do some and come back. From the recruiters perspective it helps to assess your competences and show your interests. If you did group assignments, mention that too. Other than this, supervisors search through applications using keyword search. So **use keywords for your projects**. Bulletpoints are a tool too.

## Recommendation letter
You can upload your recommendation letter in two ways: you upload it in the application form or you send the recommendation upload link to whoever is writing the letter for you and they upload it from there. The second way is useful when who is writing the letter doesn't want you to read it, to not influence them in writing it.
I don't think CERN cares if you use a way or the other, it is the author's preference to show it to you or not.

Ask some uni professor that knows you (better if you took an exam with them and it went well).
## Member States vs Associate Member States
To me it looks like Associate Member States nationals have a lower acceptance rate. I don't know if this is by policy or by chance.
## Duration
You can choose to stay 4 to 12 months, but most of the teams look for candidates that will stay 12 months. Someone gathered some data and made some stats on the studentship duration. Author: [u/super_max2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CERN/comments/kqdey9/yes_you_can_get_a_technical_student_placement/gi3zobh/) on reddit.

While 12 months is the vast majority, two thirds of the contracts last less. However, **my advice is to try and be available for 12 months**, and indicate it in the application form.
# SONRU interview
After a couple of days since the closing of the application, if you did everything correctly, it comes the most scary part for many. You receive an email asking you to complete the self-video interview. In the email they tell you the questions that you will be asked. They are exactly what they tell you:
- Briefly introduce yourself 
- Describe a project you’re proud of and why, 
- Tell about your technical/administrative strengths, 
- Why do you want to take this internship and what do you know about CERN,
- What is your ideal working environment
- Do you want to add any comment?

That's it. You get one minute to think to an answer (not recorded) and one minute to reply (obviously recorded). I was a bit nervous, and you probabily will be too. But there is no need, just answer the questions.

# Interviews with the teams
Now for the hard part. After the SONRU deadline, HR send all the candidate files to the teams for the selection. 1-3 weeks after the SONRU deadline, you can be contacted by some team - typically via email - to schedule a call. 

Most of the applicants won't get contacted back. While it does not mean yet that you are not selected, it appears that being selected without an interview is pretty hard, so the chanches are quite low at this point. Do not despair, it happens! [What to do if you're not selected](#if-im-not-selected). 

At this point you can be contacted by one or more teams. This does not mean that you're selected yet, but your chances are now a lot higher, congrats!
### How to prepare for the interview
Research them a bit! Do your homework on what they do. Search both the names and the section, try to understand roughly what they do and what they may expect you to do for them. 
### The actual interview
Don't be nervous! They will probably are interested in you just as you're interested in them! They will introduce themselves, tell you a bit about their project and why you're needed, and try to understand if and how your skills would fit on their project and in their team. To get your skills across tell them about some relevant projects. If they are developing a kryptonite hypermagnet, tell them about that one uni project where you studied kryptonite magnets to make a time curving device. If they're developing a brainfuck interpreter, tell them more about your experience with [Cow](https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW) and the time you wrote a turing machine simulator from scratch. Be relevant. 
# After the interview
After the interviews, the teams will communicate to the HR a list of three names. One is the main candidate, and the other two are 1st and 2nd reserve candidates.
The teams will not tell you if you're on the list and at which place, but they may give you some feedback.
You may be selected as main candidate by more than one team. My understanding here is that if there is a confling within a department, the HR or the department choose for you. Instead, if the conflict is across different departments they may let you choose.

# Outcome
You will receive an email after the committee meeting, with one of three outcomes:
- You are selected. Congratulations, you did it! Now you will have to provide a declaration that you will stay enrolled and get it signed by your Uni, and sign your contract!
- You are a reserve candidate. You will hold this status until the first candidate either signs or fails to sign the contract. 
- You are not selected. It happens for most candidates, i'm sorry! Check out [what to do if you are not selected](#if-im-not-selected)

# If i'm not selected
Retry if you dont succeed the first time!
